Setting up the environment:

1. Please install node.js on your system. 
2. Open the command prompt and go to the project directory (go to the Dr AI folder)
3. Run the server by typing 'node server.js'
4. Copy the localhost link that appears after running the server and paste it into the web browser.
5. You should be able to see the basic web application that we created with the help of the fine-tuned model we built.

Note:

1. Since the dataset we used to fine-tune the model is straightforward, the output you can see when given any symptoms is short and sometimes it might not give relevant outputs, no matter if we change the hyper-parameters in server.js. 

2. We wanted to make use of an authentic data source and we fed our model with the best data possible. If we had descriptions kind of the data in the dataset, we could have achieved comprehensive responses from our Dr AI. But for now, we keep it as a further enhancement since that kind of data was not found online.

3. The link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joymarhew/medical-reccomadation-dataset/data.

4. We did some pre-processing  on these datasets and the resultant dataset can be found in the project repository (Dr AI) with the name 'Symptoms Dataset - Dr.AI - Original_Dataset.csv'
